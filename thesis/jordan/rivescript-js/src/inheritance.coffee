# Recursively scan through a topic and retrieve a listing of all triggers in

# with an {inherits} tag to signify inheritance depth.
#
# * topic: The name of the topic
# * thats: Boolean, are we getting replies with %Previous or not?
# * triglvl: reference to this._topics or this._thats
# * depth: recursion depth counter
#
# Each "trigger" returned from this function is actually an array, where index
# 0 is the trigger text and index 1 is the pointer to the trigger's data within
# the original topic structure.

  # Keep in mind here that there is a difference between 'includes' and
  # 'inherits' -- topics that inherit other topics are able to OVERRIDE
  # triggers that appear in the inherited topic. This means that if the top
  # topic has a trigger of simply '*', then NO triggers are capable of
  # matching in ANY inherited topic, because even though * has the lowest
  # priority, it has an automatic priority over all inherited topics.
  #
  # The getTopicTriggers method takes this into account. All topics that
  # inherit other topics will have their triggers prefixed with a fictional
  # {inherits} tag, which would start at {inherits=0} and increment if this
  # topic has other inheriting topics. So we can use this tag to make sure
  # topics that inherit things will have their triggers always be on top of
  # the stack, from inherits=0 to inherits=n.

  # Important info about the depth vs. inheritance params to this function:
  # depth increments by 1 each time this function recursively calls itself.
  # inheritance increments by 1 only when this topic inherits another topic.
  #
  # This way, '> topic alpha includes beta inherits gamma' will have this
  # effect:
  #  alpha and beta's triggers are combined together into one matching pool,
  #  and then those triggers have higher priority than gamma's.
  #
  # The inherited option is true if this is a recursive call, from a topic
  # that inherits other topics. This forces the {inherits} tag to be added to
  # the triggers. This only applies when the top topic 'includes' another
  # topic.
